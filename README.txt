You are expected to build a binary classifier to predict whether the handwritten digit of a
given image is 0 or 1. Notice:
• you can download the dataset from MNIST; • you only need to use the data with label 0 or 1;
• please unzip the data files and put the code file in the same directory;
• you can use any model and libraries you want;
• the accuracy on the test set is supposed to reach at least 90%;
• you only need to submit the code as an attachment.

Mnist_Data为处理后的数据集
